#Want to print all products name in Arabic instead of English in POS Receipt. Is there any solution to use the Multilanguage feature in POS receipt?

If you are looking to get the POS ticket in Arabic, load the translation for the Arabic language and switch the customer language to Arabic. Now if you log in the POS you can see the product names in Arabic. (make sure that the translation for the products are loaded in DB)

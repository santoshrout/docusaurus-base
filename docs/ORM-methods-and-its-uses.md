#ORM methods and its uses?

ORM(Object Relational Mapping) is acts as a bridge between your programming language and your database. The Object Relational Mapping helps to execute SQL queries without writing them explicitly. Once the ORM is configured in an application, the user can use the OOP concepts like classes and objects to interact with the database.
Methods of ORM:
CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.
Meanwhile, it also includes other operations such as data importing to the database, exporting to files, and so forth.

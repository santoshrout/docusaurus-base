#What is unbuild order in Odoo?

Unbuild Order is a reverse process of manufacturing. Of course, it is not possible for all types of products, but for assembled products, it is possible to unassemble the components. When the manufacturing order is processed, it consumes the components, and produces the final product.
In Odoo Manufacturing App, you can Unbuild products. Two use cases can be managed:
1. You can unbuild products you have built yourself or
2. You can unbuild products you have received.

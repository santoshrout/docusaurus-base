#What are the Marketing Automation Features in Odoo?

Odoo's marketing applications are designed to manage content for social media and websites, mass communication, automation, and customer loyalty.
Let's take a look at the different marketing modules that Odoo has to offer.

Social Marketing:
The social marketing module connects the company's multiple social media pages to the Odoo database. We now have a consolidated view of our posts and events through our Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and website pages.

Email Marketing:
Odoo's email marketing software is a useful tool for automating and facilitating mass mailings to your target audience. We can create eye-catching email campaigns from the ground up and create models that cater to the target audience.

SMS Marketing:
Another tool that helps us to reach out to our customers through automated SMS is SMS marketing. Since most people have more access to their phones than to their inboxes, particularly after office hours, the SMS market reaches the target audience more easily.

Marketing Automation:
We can combine the different campaign activities and place lead management on autopilot with marketing automation. To control lead conversion, we can build campaigns that combine communication and server action.
